    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MDEV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MDEV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MDEV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported."

    "**Answer: ** I think an increase in the feature 'RM' would lead to an increase in the value of 'MDEV' because in general the more rooms in a given house the larger the square footage which carries a higher price. It would be more intuitive to answer if the data specified the type of rooms in each house (i.e. bedrooms, office, bonus, bathrooms). I think an increase in the feature 'LSTAT' would lead to a decrease in the value of 'MDEV' because in a neighborhood with  higher percentage of \"lower class\" residents one would expect higher crime rates which could in turn lower the appeal of the neighborhood to perspective buyers and therefore decreasing the value of 'MDEV'. I think an increase in the feature 'PTRATIO' would lead to a decrease in the value of 'MDEV' because for perspective homebuyers with children living in prximity to a good school district can heavily influence the price of a house. A key indicator of a good school district is one that posseses a low 'PTRATIO' where there are fewer students per teacher which in theory grants more personal attention per student."

Lastly, Client 3's house has a selling price near the maximum price given its subset of features; 8 rooms, low poverty percent and low student-teacher ratio. "

    "An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable — i.e., the model is underfitted. Run the code cell below to run the `fit_model` function ten times with different training and testing sets to see how the prediction for a specific client changes with the data it's trained on."

    "**Answer: ** Housing market prices fluctuate significately given economy, time of year, stock markets and many other factors. It would be unreasonable to think data collected in 1978 would be relevant today due to the number of factors that can affect the housing market. As I brought up in a previous question it would be very beneficial is the data included more specific feautres such as the type of rooms in each house (i.e. bedrooms, office, bonus, bathrooms), whether it has a pool or not, the overall plot size or other factors that homebuyers prioritize when looking for a new home. Given the data set and features it was created from I believe the model is robust enough to generate a good starting point to determining an appropriate selling price of a house in Boston around 1978. There is always room for negotiation. I dont believe data collected in an urban city like Boston would be applicable in a rural city. I think homebuyers in a rural city would value other features not present in this data set such as lot size when looking to buy a home. Given enough data and the appropriate feature set I believe this model could be reliably used in a real-world setting."
